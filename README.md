# Predicting Customer Service Usage Using kNN
This dataset reflects a telecommunications provider that has segmented its customer base by service usage patterns, categorizing the customers into four different usage groups. Using this data, we'll build a model that predicts the usage of a new customer by using a K-Nearest Neighbor model. The data for this analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/tabburn/telecommunications-customers/blob/main/resources/teleCust1000t.csv).

## Summary
The purpose of this project is to predict customer service usage for a telecommunications company. We'll first clean the data and get it prepared for machine learning and then make a predictive model using K-Nearest Neighbors. We'll begin with a k value of 4 then create a function to iterate through multiple values to find the best fit for our model. This analysis answers questions like:

* How can we predict customer service usage?
* What is the best k value for our model?
* What is the best accuracy of our model?
